## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SawhneyVardan/Compass-/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Focus

_Applications_ 
The idea of the Compass is to relieve the stress on guide dogs, and still allow citizens with visual disabilities to carry out daily errands, in a compact manner as a wristwatch. This can even be used for those who do not have visual impairements, and simply desire a simpler and more efficient method of guidance. 

The product uses both the Google Maps API 

**Bold** asdfasdfasdf 

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SawhneyVardan/Compass-/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
